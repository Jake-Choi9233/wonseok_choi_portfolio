          <p class="lead">
            I am Wonseok Choi, born in 2001 in South Korea. I am currently a final-year undergraduate student at Peking University's Yuanpei College, majoring in Information Management with a specialization in Big Data Management and Application. I moved to China in 2014 to pursue my studies and will graduate in July 2026. My research interests focus on Cross-Cultural NLP and AI for Social Good, with current work centered on mitigating cultural biases in large language models and building knowledge-driven systems that serve diverse communities.

            In China, there's a saying, "百闻不如一见," meaning seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times.
            When I returned to campus after completing my military service in April 2024, this proverb took on new meaning.
            In Asst. Prof. Tong Wei's database course, his emphasis on learning from practice resonated deeply with me.
            I realized that no amount of lectures could replace hands on experience, so I decided to push beyond classroom assignments.
            That's when I joined the Chinese encyclopedia platform project as a core team member, ready to turn theory into real world impact.

          <p>
            Over the course of a year, I worked on everything from designing the domain ontology to deploying the whole system and training junior students.
            The ancient documents had complex hierarchical structures that needed careful consideration.
            I collected documents and metadata from various sources, then used Python to clean and structure them.
            Subsequently, I built an advanced search system and a semantic search system on a cloud server using BERT ancient Chinese encoder and DiskANN index so scholars could search based on meaning rather than just keywords.
            This experience solidified my practical foundation in domain research and data engineering.
            Seeing how technology could genuinely help humanities scholars, I wanted to become a cultural bridge, using my diverse background to make broader contributions.

          <h2>Oil Spill Detection Drone</h2>
          <p>
            Transferring from text domain to computer vision, I joined the Lingnan-Yuanpei STEM competition tackling oil spill detection in Hong Kong's harbor.
            One of my teammates and I designed a low-cost drone prototype using Raspberry Pi and built a dual-model detection system using U-Net for daytime oil spill segmentation and YOLOv5 for nighttime infrared detection, which was fine-tuned with the data we labeled ourselves.

          </div>
          <p>
            Besides, I also developed a real-time dashboard integrating weather APIs and LLM-powered analysis to predict oil spill trajectories based on flight altitude.

          <p>
            This project expanded my technical range beyond NLP and reinforced my belief in AI for social good.
            I realized that integrating LLM reasoning into real-world applications could create valuable insights, sparking my interest to explore this area more deeply.

          <p>
            In late 2025, I joined Asst. Prof. Yi Bu's lab to conduct research on mitigating cultural bias in LLMs.
            Starting from building a taxonomy of 76 value categories, I led the methodology for constructing a Cultural Value Ontology using the Memoryless CQbyCQ method and designed a hypergraph-based retrieval approach to integrate structured cultural knowledge into the reasoning process.
            For demographic retrieval, we combined BM25s and e5-base embeddings with reciprocal rank fusion.
            For the reasoning process, we implemented multi-agent simulation with Value-Persona Agents and a Judgement Agent to synthesize culturally grounded responses.
            This research convinced me that structured cultural knowledge is essential for making LLMs more inclusive and strengthened my commitment to continue AI research that serves people across diverse cultural backgrounds.

            I built an interactive Premier League visualization with D3.js to surface value for money players.
            The dashboard lets users compare salary and performance, explore team reliance patterns, and spot overpaid or underrated players through radar charts, sunburst views, and cost effectiveness panels.
            The goal is to replace hype with data driven scouting insights.
